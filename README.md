# PySavingsEnhancer

PySavingsEnhancer is a Python project dedicated to optimizing and enhancing the Home Federal Savings Bank codebase. The project focuses on both refactoring the existing code for improved readability and implementing a comprehensive testing suite to ensure the reliability of the banking application.

## Project Structure

- **`bank.py`**: The main script containing the enhanced Home Federal Savings Bank implementation.
- **`test_bank.py`**: A thorough test script with various test cases to validate the functionality of the `value` function.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/PySavingsEnhancer.git
   cd PySavingsEnhancer
   ```

2. **Run Tests:**
   Ensure that you have pytest installed, and then run the tests:
   ```bash
   pip install pytest
   pytest test_bank.py
   ```

3. **Usage:**
   Execute the `main` function in `bank.py` to interact with the enhanced Home Federal Savings Bank application.

   ```python
   python bank.py
   ```

## Features and Enhancements

- **Code Refactoring:** Improved code structure and readability for a better understanding.
- **Comprehensive Testing:** Thoroughly tested `value` function to ensure robust functionality.
- **Optimizations:** Enhancements made to the savings functionality for improved performance.

## Test Cases

- `test_hello`: Checks if the `value` function correctly returns 0 for greetings that start with "hello."
- `test_h`: Tests scenarios where the greeting starts with "h" but not "hello," ensuring the function returns 20.
- `test_noH`: Verifies that the function returns 100 for greetings that don't start with either "hello" or "h."
- `test_capital`: Ensures the function handles case insensitivity correctly.
